# Cheesecake Factory Web Scraper

I created this web scraper to get the price and calorie content information for every edible item at the Cheesecake Factory. Evertyime I go to the Cheesecake Factory I wonder how much it would cost to buy one of everything on the menu...  
The answer will shock you ðŸ˜± [**Add Link to deployed site**]

### **A few things to note:**

1. No beverages are included. This means no cocktails, no soda, no coffee. [*This may change in the future*]
2. Certain items have a range of calories depending on add-ons. In these situations, I picked the first calorie count listed. Same goes with pricing.
3. Cheesecakes have a range of prices and the individual prices are not listed on the website -- Took an average of the range and assigned that price to each cheesecake.
4. I did not include the Kids Menu, Lunch Favorites, or Happy Hour menus as they include duplicate items that already exist, but at smaller portions/prices.
5. Menu descriptions are not included. [*This may change in the future*]

Shoutout Cheesecake Factory -- Love the massive menu even though I always get the same thing every time.
